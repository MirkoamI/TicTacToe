TIC-TAC-TOE UNIVERSE

This is a simple web-based project that includes two versions of Tic-Tac-Toe: the standard version and the Ultimate version.

THE GAMES

1. Classic Mode
Standard 3x3 board. 
- The 2-player mode is just local multiplayer. 
- The 1-player mode uses a Minimax algorithm. It’s essentially a perfect player, so if you play correctly, you can only ever hope for a draw.

2. Ultimate Mode
A 9x9 board made of nine smaller 3x3 grids. 
- Where you move in a small grid forces your opponent to move in that specific "big" region next.
- Winning a small grid claims that section of the big board.
- The AI here uses Alpha-Beta pruning. It isn't "perfect" like the classic one because the game is too complex, but it looks several moves ahead and plays aggressively.

HOW TO PLAY
